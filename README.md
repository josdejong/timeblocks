# timeblocks

A timeblocks extension for [vis.js](http://visjs.org). This visualization uses the Timeline of vis.js to display a different sort of information: a vertical numeric axis, and blocks which have a start and end time, and an `yMin` and `yMax` for the vertical axis. Additionally, labels can be displayed alongside the vertical axis.
